# Prerequisites

You can integrate Google Tag Manager that [Event](broken-reference) as a tag**.**

We assume that you already have some basic understanding of Google Tag Manager, and that you have a clear understanding of how Google Tag Manager works.

If you don't familiar with Google Tag Manager, please refer to the links below:

* ****[**Set up and install Tag Manager**](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en\&ref\_topic=3441530#zippy=%2Cwhat-is-a-tag%2Cwhat-is-an-account%2Cwhat-is-a-container)****
{% endhint %}

So basically the integration between [Event](broken-reference) and Google Tag Manager only covers this part of `Tag`.
