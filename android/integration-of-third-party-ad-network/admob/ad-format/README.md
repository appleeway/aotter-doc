*   ****[**Native**](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/native/start)****

    Customizable ads that match the look and feel of your app. You decide how and where they're placed, so the layout is more consistent with your app's design.
*   ****[**Banner**](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner)****

    Rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of the device screen. Banner ads stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, and can refresh automatically after a certain period of time. If you're new to mobile advertising, they're a great place to start.
